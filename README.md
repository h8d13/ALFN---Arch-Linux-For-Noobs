# ALFN---Arch-Linux-For-Noobs

You saw the arch hype and their long ass guides on the websites? 
Great, now you're here. 

## Installation Hacks

`archinstall` for the classic debian style noob installer.

Couple of things to watch here:
Make sure to set the proper keyboard layout, and also to set a root password. 
Make sure to go to profile > type > and select a desktop environment (Window managers can be more complex for noobs.)
I recommend trying Budgie, it looks much more modern and slick than most in 2025. 

Now press install > wait for it to finish. 

Will prompt you with would you like to chroot... No we are noobs.  
You will get to shell at the end of installation, we are noobs so we don't care `exit`. 

It brings you to another shell, damn. If you skip this you're f*ed (I think for proper clean-up): `shutdown -h now`

Reboot from the drive you isntalled on.
