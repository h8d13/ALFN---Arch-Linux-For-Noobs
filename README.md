# ALFN---Arch-Linux-For-Noobs

You saw the arch hype and their long ass guides on the websites? 
Great, now you're here. 

## Installation Hacks

`archinstall` for the classic debian style noob installer.

### Important Setup Steps
* Make sure to set the proper keyboard layout
* Set a root password
* Go to profile > type > and select a desktop environment (Window managers can be more complex for beginners)
* Recommended desktop environment: 
  * Try Budgie, it looks much more modern and slick than most in 2025

Now press install > wait for it to finish. 

Will prompt you with would you like to chroot... No we are noobs.  
You will get to shell at the end of installation, we are noobs so we don't care `exit`. 

It brings you to another shell, damn. If you skip this you're f*ed (I think for proper clean-up): `shutdown -h now`

## Starting out. 

Reboot from the drive you installed on. 

Depending on if you set a profile up in the installer you either log in as root or as your profile name.
